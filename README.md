## About the project

This repository was made to share the code that was sent by Velv as a challenge.

# Instructions

This project was made with Laravel and Vue.js.
You will need to have:
- PHP 8.0
- Composer
- Node.js *
- NPM *

_* Node and NPM will only be used in develpment_

#### Setup: 
Download the code via Git or ZIP. Inside the folder, run ``` composer install ``` wait until the process ends and then run ```php artisan serve``` it will run the PHP built-in server. Now you can access it with something like: ```http://localhost:8000```

## Acess to the server
The code will be exposed with Ngrok, tunneling localhost. The tunneling expires in 2 hours, so I will share the link when the meeting is near.
